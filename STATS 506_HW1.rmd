Problem 1:
```{r}
data <- read.table('wine.data', header = FALSE, sep = ",")

col_names <- c(
  "Class", "Alcohol", "Malic acid", "Ash",
  "Alcalinity of ash", "Magnesium", "Total phenols", "Flavanoids",
  "Nonflavanoid phenols", "Proanthocyanins", "Color intensity", "Hue",
  "OD280/OD315 of diluted wines", "Proline"
)
colnames(data) <- col_names
```

(c)ï¼š  
(1) The wine with the highest alcohol content belongs to which class?
```{r}
highest <- data$Class[which.max(data$Alcohol)]

cat("The wine has the highest alcohol belongs to Class", highest)
```

(2) The wine with the lowest alcohol content belongs to which class?
```{r}
lowest <- data$Class[which.min(data$Alcohol)]

cat("The wine has the lowest alcohol belongs to Class", lowest)
```

(3) German beers have, on average, 114 mg/l of magnesium. How many of these wines have higher levels of magnesium than that? (You may assume that the magnesium reported in the data is in the same units.)
```{r}
cat("The number of wines have higher levels of magnesium than German beers is:", sum(data$Magnesium > 114))
```

(4) Within each class, how many wines have higher levels of magnesium than average German beer?
```{r}
c1 <- aggregate(Magnesium ~ Class, data, function(x) sum(x > 114))
c1
```

(d):  
```{r}
overall <- c(0, colMeans(data[,-1])) 
class <- aggregate(. ~ Class, data = data, FUN = mean)
t1 <-rbind('Overall Average' = overall, 'Class Average' = class)
t1
```
(e):  
```{r}
class_pairs <- combn(unique(data$Class), 2)

for (i in 1:ncol(class_pairs)) {
  class1 <- class_pairs[1, i]
  class2 <- class_pairs[2, i]
  ash1 <- data$Ash[data$Class == class1]
  ash2 <- data$Ash[data$Class == class2]
  result <- t.test(ash1, ash2)
  
  cat("Class", class1, "vs. Class", class2, ":\n")
  cat("p-value:", result$p.value, "\n")
  cat("\n")
}
```
According to the results of the test, we can see that the p-value for class 1 and class 2 is very small (less than 0.05), so we can conclude that there are significant difference between the level of Ash in class 1 and 2.  
Same situation for class 2 and 3, the p-value is less than 0.05, so the level of Ash differs across Class 2 and 3.  
However, the p-value for class 1 and 3 is 0.64, which is greater than 0.05, so there is no significant difference in Ash between these two classes.

Problem 2:
(a):  
```{r}
isPerfectPower <- function(x, power) {
  root <- round(x^(1/power))
  if (root^power == x) {
    return(list(isPerfect = TRUE, root = root))
  }
  else {
    return(list(isPerfect = FALSE, root = NA))
  }
}
```

(b):  
```{r}
findRootPower <- function(x) {
  power <- 2  # Start with power = 2
  while (power <= 1000) {
    result <- isPerfectPower(x, power)
    if (result$isPerfect) {
      return(paste(x, "=", result$root, "^", power))
    }
    power <- power + 1  # Increment the power
  }
  return(paste(x, "is not a perfect power within the specified range."))
}

print(findRootPower(27))
print(findRootPower(13060694016))
print(findRootPower(7776))
print(findRootPower(170859375))
print(findRootPower(58247422))
print(findRootPower(94143178827))

```

(1) Yes, the inputs and outputs are as described.  
(2) Yes, they are valid cards with no duplicates.
(3) Yes, they are correct.
(4) Yes, the sampling part ensures that it is without replacement. If the number of player is more than 10, it gives "Number of players must be between 2 and 10." and then a Null set.
